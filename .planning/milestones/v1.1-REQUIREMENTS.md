# Requirements: GSD for GitHub v1.1

**Defined:** 2026-01-22
**Milestone:** v1.1 — Plan & Execute Commands
**Core Value:** Enable autonomous AI-driven development that runs in CI/CD, responds to GitHub issue comments, creates and updates planning artifacts in the repo, and tracks progress via GitHub issues.

## v1.1 Requirements

### Phase Planning

- [x] **PLAN-01**: `gsd:plan-phase` command parses phase number and triggers phase planning workflow — Delivered in Phase 7
- [x] **PLAN-02**: Phase planner creates detailed execution plans with tasks, dependencies, and verification — Delivered in Phase 7
- [x] **PLAN-03**: Plans are committed to `.planning/phases/{n}/` directory — Delivered in Phase 7

### Phase Execution

- [x] **EXEC-01**: `gsd:execute-phase` command executes planned actions with wave-based parallelization — Delivered in Phase 8
- [x] **EXEC-02**: Agent can read state from `.planning/` folder to determine resume point (GSD internal) — Delivered in Phase 8
- [x] **RETRY-01**: Workflow can resume from last incomplete action on retry — Delivered in Phase 8

### Issue Status Updates (Phase 9)

- [x] **EXEC-03**: Agent updates issue status as tasks complete (pending → in-progress → complete) — Delivered in Phase 9

### Issue Tracking

- [x] **ISSUE-01**: Each action in a plan creates a corresponding GitHub issue — Delivered in Phase 9
- [x] **ISSUE-02**: Issue body contains action details, verification criteria, and phase context — Delivered in Phase 9

### Additional Requirements (Discovered During Milestone)

- [x] **TRIGGER-01**: Workflow triggers on `issues.labeled` event when label is "good first issue" — Delivered in Phase 13
- [x] **TRIGGER-02**: Read issue title + body, join with `---`, pass as prompt to `formatCcrCommandWithOutput` — Delivered in Phase 13
- [x] **TRIGGER-03**: Remove `parseMilestoneNumber` from new-milestone flow (GSD determines number) — Delivered in Phase 13
- [x] **PARSE-01**: After GSD completes, parse `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` for milestone title and version (vX) — Delivered in Phase 13
- [x] **PARSE-02**: Parse `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase numbers and titles — Delivered in Phase 13
- [x] **UPDATE-01**: Update original GitHub issue with milestone info and phase links — Delivered in Phase 13

## v2 Requirements (Deferred)

### Multi-Repo Support

- **MREPO-01**: Support for cross-repository workflow orchestration
- **MREPO-02**: Issue linking across repositories
- **MREPO-03**: Shared planning context for multi-repo projects

### Integration

- **JIRA-01**: Bidirectional sync between GitHub issues and Jira tickets
- **JIRA-02**: Import existing Jira issues as GSD actions
- **JIRA-03**: Export GSD plans to Jira epics

### Analytics

- **ANALYT-01**: Track velocity metrics across milestones
- **ANALYT-02**: Burndown chart generation
- **ANALYT-03**: Performance dashboards

## Out of Scope

| Feature                      | Reason                                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Jira integration             | Defer to v2 with GitHub-Jira mirroring |
| Multi-repo workflows         | Single repo focus for v1.x             |
| Real-time progress dashboard | Issue comments sufficient for v1.x     |
| Complex branching strategies | Main branch workflow for v1.x          |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase    | Status   |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| PLAN-01     | Phase 7  | Complete |
| PLAN-02     | Phase 7  | Complete |
| PLAN-03     | Phase 7  | Complete |
| EXEC-01     | Phase 8  | Complete |
| EXEC-02     | Phase 8  | Complete |
| RETRY-01    | Phase 8  | Complete |
| ISSUE-01    | Phase 9  | Complete |
| ISSUE-02    | Phase 9  | Complete |
| EXEC-03     | Phase 9  | Complete |
| TRIGGER-01  | Phase 13 | Complete |
| TRIGGER-02  | Phase 13 | Complete |
| TRIGGER-03  | Phase 13 | Complete |
| PARSE-01    | Phase 13 | Complete |

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 15 of 15 v1.1 requirements (100%)
**Adjusted:** None — all requirements delivered as specified
**Dropped:** None

**Note:** v1.1 milestone audit initially flagged Phase 9 as "not executed" and 3 requirements as pending. Investigation revealed all 3 Phase 9 plans were executed (SUMMARY.md files exist) and all integration points were wired (createIssuesForTasks, getPhaseIssues, updateIssueStatus all called in phase-planner.js and phase-executor.js). Audit findings were based on outdated analysis.

**Key Deliverables:**

1. Phase planning and execution commands fully functional
2. GitHub issues for task tracking with automatic creation
3. Status label tracking (pending → in-progress → complete)
4. Comprehensive test suite (469 tests, 94.15% coverage)
5. CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
6. Label-triggered milestone creation
7. CCR command formatting helper
8. Output parsing improvements

**Technical Achievement:**

- All v1.1 requirements delivered and validated
- 21 plans executed across 8 phases
- 94.15% test coverage across 55 source files
- Production-ready GitHub Action with autonomous AI capabilities
