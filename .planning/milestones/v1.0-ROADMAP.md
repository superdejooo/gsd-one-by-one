# Milestone v1.0: MVP — GitHub-native GSD via Reusable Action

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-22
**Phases:** 1-6
**Total Plans:** 19

## Overview

GSD for GitHub transforms the Get Shit Done project management system into a GitHub-native, autonomous AI workflow. The v1.0 milestone delivers a reusable GitHub Action that responds to `@gsd-bot new-milestone` comments, creates planning documents in `.github/planning/`, manages branches with proper naming conventions, and validates user permissions before execution.

## Phases

### Phase 1: GitHub Action Foundation

**Goal**: Establish the reusable GitHub Action infrastructure with proper triggers, permissions, and concurrency control
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Create reusable GitHub Action with workflow triggers and basic inputs
- [x] 01-02: Configure scoped permissions and Node.js 24.x runtime
- [x] 01-03: Implement concurrency control and clean exit handling

### Phase 2: Command Parsing & Config

**Goal**: Parse @gsd-bot commands from issue comments, validate user input, and load user configuration
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Create parser module with parseComment and parseArguments
- [x] 02-02: Integrate parser into main action entry point
- [x] 02-03: Load config file from repository with defaults and add command validation with input sanitization

### Phase 3: CCR Integration

**Goal**: Bundle and configure Claude Code Router for CI-safe, non-interactive LLM execution via stdin pipe
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Install Agent SDK with pinned version and bundle into distributable
- [x] 03-02: Create LLM integration layer with SDK wrapper and prompt templates
- [x] 03-03: Configure API key passing and verify non-interactive execution
- [x] 03-04: Gap closure - Add NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE and clean up architecture artifacts

### Phase 4: GitHub Integration & Response

**Goal**: Enable GitHub API operations for posting comments, creating branches, and committing artifacts
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: GitHub API operations with throttled octokit client and error/success message formatting
- [x] 04-02: Git operations module with branch creation and naming conventions (milestone and phase branches)
- [x] 04-03: Git identity configuration and centralized error handling with GitHub comment posting

### Phase 5: Milestone Creation Workflow

**Goal**: Implement the complete gsd:new-milestone workflow including planning docs and requirements gathering
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: Create planning documents (PROJECT.md, STATE.md, ROADMAP.md) in correct location
- [x] 05-02: Implement requirements gathering with multi-turn comment interaction
- [x] 05-03: Add context persistence across workflow runs for requirements gathering
- [x] 05-04: Commit planning docs and post completion summary comment

### Phase 6: Security & Authorization

**Goal**: Implement permission validation and finalize error handling for production readiness
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Create authorization validator module with GitHub API permission checking
- [x] 06-02: Integrate authorization check into index.js and extend error handling

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Create wrapper skill, not modify GSD — Keep GSD unchanged, easier maintenance
- GitHub CLI for API calls — Simplest integration, built into Actions
- Config in `.github/gsd-config.json` — Separate from GSD project config
- Exit workflow after post — Avoid complexity of polling/retrying
- Branch naming with milestone/phase — Organized, easy to identify (`gsd/{n}/{p}-{slug}`)
- Phase + status labels only — Simple scheme for v1, user-defined
- Requirements in comments (follow-up allowed) — Interactive, allows clarification

**Issues Resolved:**

- Standard GSD cannot run reliably in non-interactive CI environments
- Need for GitHub-native workflow (issues, comments, PRs)
- Autonomous agent execution in CI/CD (non-interactive)
- Visual project board with tickets/phases

**Issues Deferred:**

- Action-level GitHub issues (phases only later)
- `gsd:plan-phase` command (v1.1)
- `gsd:execute-phase` command (v1.1)
- `gsd:verify-work` command (v1.1)
- Jira integration (v2.0)
- Bidirectional status sync (agent reads ticket status)
- CCR stdin pipe LLM execution (v2.0)

**Technical Debt:**

- Phase 4 verification file was missing (created during audit)
- CCR-05 (stdin pipe execution) deferred to v2
