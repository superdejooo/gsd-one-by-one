## Requirements Coverage

### Complete (6/9)

| ID       | Requirement                                     | Phase | Evidence                                      |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| PLAN-01  | `gsd:plan-phase` command parses phase number    | 7     | validator.js ALLOWLIST, index.js dispatch     |
| PLAN-02  | Phase planner creates detailed execution plans  | 7     | phase-planner.js executePhaseWorkflow         |

| EXEC-01  | `gsd:execute-phase` executes planned actions    | 8     | phase-executor.js with 30-min timeout         |
| EXEC-02  | Agent can read state from `.planning/`          | 8     | GSD internal - verified working               |
| RETRY-01 | Workflow can resume from last incomplete action | 8     | GSD internal - verified working               |

### Pending (3/9)

| ID       | Requirement                                  | Phase | Blocker              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------------------- |
| ISSUE-01 | Each action creates a GitHub issue           | 9     | Phase 9 not executed |
| ISSUE-02 | Issue body contains action details           | 9     | Phase 9 not executed |
| EXEC-03  | Agent updates issue status as tasks complete | 9     | Phase 9 not executed |

**Impact:** Users must track progress via GitHub comments instead of automated issues.

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Name                             | Status          | VERIFICATION.md                  |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 7     | Phase Planning Command           | COMPLETE ✓      | PASSED (3/3 must-haves)          |
| 8     | Phase Execution Command          | COMPLETE ✓      | PASSED (4/4 must-haves)          |
| 8.1   | GitHub Projects & Issue Tracking | COMPLETE ✓      | Missing (orphaned code)          |
| 9     | Issue Tracking Integration       | NOT EXECUTED ❌ | N/A                              |
| 10    | Test Infrastructure              | COMPLETE ✓      | Missing (validated by 347 tests) |

**Phase 9 Deferral:** Intentional — Phase 10 (testing) prioritized over Phase 9 (issue tracking).

### Cross-Phase Wiring

| From                | To                                | Status      |

| Phase 8 → Phase 8.1 | Execution uses project validation | WIRED ✓     |
| Phase 8.1 → Phase 9 | Labels module created for issues  | ORPHANED ⚠️ |

### E2E Flow Verification

| Flow                       | Status     | Notes                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `@gsd-bot new-milestone N` | COMPLETE ✓ | Requirements gathering, planning docs, branch  |
| `@gsd-bot plan-phase N`    | COMPLETE ✓ | CCR execution, output posting                  |
| `@gsd-bot execute-phase N` | COMPLETE ✓ | CCR execution, structured output, hasQuestions |
| Issue tracking flow        | MISSING ❌ | No issue creation or status updates            |

## Tech Debt Summary

### Orphaned Code (Phase 8.1)

**File:** `src/lib/labels.js`
**Exports:** 4 functions + 1 constant
**Usage:** 0 external consumers
**Reason:** Created for Phase 9, which was never executed

```javascript
// All exports unused:
export const STATUS_LABELS = [...]
export async function ensureLabelsExist(owner, repo, labels)
export async function applyLabels(owner, repo, issueNumber, labels)
export async function updateIssueStatus(owner, repo, issueNumber, newStatus)
```

**Risk:** Low — Code is tested (100% coverage), ready to integrate when Phase 9 executes.

### Missing Implementation (Phase 9)

**File:** `src/lib/issues.js` — Does not exist
**Plans:** 09-01-PLAN.md, 09-02-PLAN.md, 09-03-PLAN.md exist but never executed

**Missing Integration Points:**

- `phase-planner.js` → `createIssuesForTasks` call
- `phase-executor.js` → `updateIssueStatus` call

---

## Test Coverage Validation

**Total Tests:** 347
**Passing:** 347 (100%)
**Coverage:** 94.15%

| Module Type            | Coverage |
| ---------------------- | -------- |
| Entry point (index.js) | 84.21%   |
| Workflow orchestrators | 93-100%  |
| GitHub API modules     | 97-100%  |
| Support modules        | 100%     |

All executed phases have comprehensive test coverage validating integration.

## Recommendations

### Ship v1.1 with Documented Limitations

**Action:** Release v1.1, defer Phase 9 to v1.2

**Justification:**

1. Core value delivered — autonomous AI-driven development via GitHub comments ✓
2. All three commands work end-to-end ✓
3. 94.15% test coverage validates stability ✓
4. No runtime errors or broken flows ✓
5. Clear upgrade path for Phase 9 in v1.2 ✓

### Required Documentation

Add to README.md:

```markdown
## Known Limitations (v1.1)

**Issue Tracking:** Automated GitHub issue creation and status updates are
not yet implemented. Users can:

- Track progress via GitHub comments
- Review planning documents in `.planning/` folder
- Manually create tracking issues if needed

**Roadmap:** Issue tracking integration planned for v1.2.
```

### v1.2 Roadmap

1. Execute Phase 9 plans (3 plans, ~30 min)
2. Wire `labels.js` into `issues.js`
3. Add integration points to `phase-planner.js` and `phase-executor.js`
4. Create tests for issue tracking flows
5. Update documentation

---

## Audit Conclusion

**Milestone v1.1:** DELIVERABLE

**Summary:** GSD for GitHub v1.1 delivers its core value of autonomous AI-driven development via GitHub issue comments. While issue tracking (Phase 9) remains incomplete, the three primary commands (`new-milestone`, `plan-phase`, `execute-phase`) are fully operational with 94.15% test coverage.

**Decision:** Ship v1.1, track Phase 9 for v1.2.
