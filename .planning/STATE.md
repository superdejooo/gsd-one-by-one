# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-01-21)

**Core value:** Enable autonomous AI-driven development that runs in CI/CD, responds to GitHub issue comments, creates and updates planning artifacts in the repo, and tracks progress via GitHub issues - all without requiring local CLI usage.
**Current focus:** GitHub Integration & Response (Phase 4)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 6 (CCR Integration)
Plan: 4 of 4 in current phase
Status: Phase complete (verified)
Last activity: 2026-01-21 — Completed 03-04-PLAN.md (gap closure)

Progress: [████████████░] 52%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: 2 min
- Total execution time: 0.48 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01    | 3     | 3     | 3 min    |
| 02    | 3     | 3     | 3 min    |
| 03    | 4     | 4     | 2 min    |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 9 min, 3 min, 4 min, 3 min, 1 min
- Trend: Stable at 2-3 min (gap closure faster at 1 min)

**Phase 3 Complete (Verified):**
- 4/4 plans executed (8 min total)
- CCR 2.1.15 stdin pipe architecture
- Claude Code CLI + GSD plugin integrated
- Agent SDK completely removed (stdin pipe only)
- NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE: true for CI safety
- Complete non-interactive CI/CD execution ready
- Verification gaps closed

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**From 01-02 (Bundling):**
- Used @vercel/ncc for single-file bundling (standard for GitHub Actions)
- Node.js 24.x runtime configured explicitly to satisfy WORK-03 requirement
- Build script pattern established: `npm run build`

**From 02-02 (Parser Integration):**
- Early exit when bot not mentioned - no wasted processing on irrelevant comments
- Separate parsing from validation - cleaner architecture, easier to test

**From 02-03 (Config Loading & Validation):**
- Allowlist validation (not denylist) per OWASP security guidelines
- Only "new-milestone" in allowlist for v1 - extensible array for future commands
- GitHub token defaults to github.token for workflow convenience
- Config defaults include all 6 phases and 4 status labels for future use
- Shell metacharacters sanitized: [;&|`$()] per OWASP Input Validation Cheat Sheet

**From 03-01 (Agent SDK Installation):**
- Agent SDK pinned to exact version 0.2.14 (no ^ prefix) per CCR-02 requirement
- Temporary import added for bundling verification - will be moved to src/llm/agent.js in Plan 03-02
- CCR architecture: Agent SDK is CLIENT library (bundled), CCR is PROXY SERVICE (workflow-installed)

**From 03-02 (CCR Config & Agent SDK Integration):**
- CCR config uses $VAR_NAME syntax for runtime env var interpolation by CCR service
- NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE: true prevents CI hangs and prompts
- permissionMode: acceptEdits auto-approves file edits in CI environment
- Multi-provider priority: OpenRouter > Anthropic > DeepSeek based on available API keys
- Agent SDK routes through CCR via ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL env var

**From 03-03 (API Key Passing & Non-Interactive Execution):**
- Architecture pivot: Agent SDK deprecated in favor of stdin pipe execution
- CCR 2.1.15 wraps Claude Code CLI for non-interactive CI/CD execution
- Stdin pipe pattern: `echo "/gsd:command" | ccr code`
- Claude Code CLI + GSD plugin installed before CCR in workflow
- Full CCR config structure (LOG, StatusLine, Router, Providers)
- Bundle optimized: 32,387 lines (Agent SDK imports removed)

**From 03-04 (Gap Closure - Verification Failures):**
- NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE: true added to CCR config (prevents CI hangs)
- Agent SDK completely removed from package.json (architecture finalized)
- ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL removed from workflow (no longer needed for stdin pipe)
- Architecture now consistent across all artifacts (no mixed signals)
- setup:ccr script fixed for ESM compatibility
