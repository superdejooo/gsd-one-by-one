# GSD for GitHub v1.1 - Cross-Phase Integration Check

**Milestone:** v1.1 — Plan & Execute Commands
**Check Date:** 2026-01-23
**Checker:** Integration Verification Agent

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status:** OPERATIONAL WITH LIMITATIONS

**Core Functionality:** All three primary commands (`new-milestone`, `plan-phase`, `execute-phase`) are fully wired and operational end-to-end.

**Integration Status:**

- **Connected Phases:** 4 of 5 phases (Phases 7, 8, 8.1, 10)
- **Orphaned Code:** 2 modules created but unused (labels.js, projects.js - partially)
- **Missing Phase:** Phase 9 (Issue Tracking Integration) - planned but never executed
- **Milestone Deliverability:** DELIVERABLE with documented limitations

---

## Phase-by-Phase Integration Analysis

### Phase 7: Phase Planning Command

**Status:** FULLY INTEGRATED ✓

**Provides:**

- `src/milestone/phase-planner.js` with `executePhaseWorkflow` and `parsePhaseNumber`
- `plan-phase` command in ALLOWED_COMMANDS

**Consumed By:**

- `src/index.js` (lines 103-113) - command dispatch
- Test suite: `src/milestone/phase-planner.test.js` (205 lines, 100% coverage)

**Export/Import Verification:**

```javascript
// Exported from phase-planner.js
export { executePhaseWorkflow, parsePhaseNumber };

// Imported in index.js (line 15)
import { executePhaseWorkflow } from "./milestone/phase-planner.js";

// Used in index.js (line 106)
const result = await executePhaseWorkflow(context, parsed.args || "");
```

**Integration Points:**

- Uses `postComment` from `lib/github.js` ✓
- Uses `formatErrorComment` from `errors/formatter.js` ✓
- Uses `child_process.exec` via promisify ✓
- Uses `fs/promises` for output file handling ✓

**Status:** All exports used, all dependencies connected, no orphaned code.

---

### Phase 8: Phase Execution Command

**Status:** FULLY INTEGRATED ✓

**Provides:**

- `src/milestone/phase-executor.js` with `executePhaseExecutionWorkflow` and output parsing
- `execute-phase` command in ALLOWED_COMMANDS
- Enhanced output parsing: `parseExecutionOutput`, `formatExecutionComment`

**Consumed By:**

- `src/index.js` (lines 116-126) - command dispatch
- Test suite: `src/milestone/phase-executor.test.js` (10,418 bytes)

**Export/Import Verification:**

```javascript
// Exported from phase-executor.js
export { executePhaseExecutionWorkflow };

// Imported in index.js (line 16)
import { executePhaseExecutionWorkflow } from "./milestone/phase-executor.js";

// Used in index.js (line 119)
const result = await executePhaseExecutionWorkflow(context, parsed.args || "");
```

**Integration Points:**

- Uses `postComment` from `lib/github.js` ✓
- Uses `formatErrorComment` from `errors/formatter.js` ✓
- Uses `child_process.exec` with 30-min timeout ✓
- Returns `hasQuestions` flag for conversational continuation ✓

**Key Enhancement:** Structured output parsing (not present in phase-planner) - extracts completed actions, next steps, questions from markdown.

**Status:** All exports used, all dependencies connected, ready for Phase 9 integration.

---

### Phase 8.1: GitHub Projects & Issue Tracking

**Status:** PARTIALLY INTEGRATED ⚠️

**Provides:**

- `src/lib/labels.js` - Label management (STATUS_LABELS, ensureLabelsExist, updateIssueStatus)
- `src/lib/projects.js` - GitHub Projects v2 queries (getProject, getIterations, findIteration)

**Consumed By:**

- `src/milestone/index.js` (line 23) - imports `findIteration` for project validation
- Test suite: `src/lib/labels.test.js`, `src/lib/projects.test.js` (97-100% coverage)

**Export Usage Analysis:**

**labels.js exports:**

```javascript
export const STATUS_LABELS = [...]
export async function ensureLabelsExist(owner, repo, labels)
export async function applyLabels(owner, repo, issueNumber, labels)
export async function updateIssueStatus(owner, repo, issueNumber, newStatus)
```

**Usage:**

- `STATUS_LABELS` - NOT USED ❌
- `ensureLabelsExist` - NOT USED ❌
- `applyLabels` - NOT USED ❌
- `updateIssueStatus` - NOT USED ❌

**projects.js exports:**

```javascript
export async function getProject(owner, projectNumber, isOrg)
export async function getIterations(projectId)
export async function findIteration(owner, projectNumber, iterationTitle, isOrg)
```

**Usage:**

- `getProject` - USED INTERNALLY (by findIteration) ✓
- `getIterations` - USED INTERNALLY (by findIteration) ✓
- `findIteration` - USED EXTERNALLY (by milestone/index.js) ✓

**Integration Points:**

- `milestone/index.js` calls `findIteration` in `validateProjectIteration` (line 82) ✓
- Validation is advisory only - warns if iteration not found, does not block workflow ✓
- References `docs/project-setup.md` for manual setup instructions ✓

**Orphaned Code:**

- ALL label management functions (4 exports from labels.js)
- Reason: Phase 9 (which would consume these) was never executed

**Status:**

- projects.js: CONNECTED (1 of 3 exports used externally)
- labels.js: ORPHANED (0 of 4 exports used)

---

### Phase 9: Issue Tracking Integration

**Status:** NOT EXECUTED ❌

**Planned But Missing:**

- `src/lib/issues.js` - Does not exist
- Issue creation from PLAN.md tasks
- Issue status updates during execution

**Expected Exports (from 09-01-PLAN.md):**

```javascript
// File does not exist
export function extractTasksFromPlan(planContent)
export function formatIssueBody(task, phaseNumber, phaseName)
export function createIssuesForTasks(owner, repo, tasks, phaseNumber, phaseName)
export function getPhaseIssues(owner, repo, phaseNumber)
```

**Expected Consumers:**

- Phase planner workflow (create issues after planning)
- Phase executor workflow (update issue status as tasks complete)

**Dependency Impact:**

- Phase 8.1 `labels.js` created FOR Phase 9, but Phase 9 never executed
- Requirements ISSUE-01, ISSUE-02, EXEC-03 remain PENDING

**Why Not Executed:**
According to STATE.md, Phase 9 appears in "Next Steps" as:

```markdown
- [ ] Phase 9: Issue Tracking Integration
  - Run `/gsd:discuss-phase 9` to gather context
  - Run `/gsd:plan-phase 9` to create execution plans
```

Plans exist (09-01-PLAN.md, 09-02-PLAN.md, 09-03-PLAN.md) but no execution occurred.

**Status:** Phase completely skipped - plans created, no code written.

---

### Phase 10: Test for Each Service, Method, Feature and Flow

**Status:** FULLY INTEGRATED ✓

**Provides:**

- Test infrastructure (vitest, coverage thresholds)
- 20 test files covering all modules
- 347 tests with 94.15% overall coverage
- CI integration via GitHub Actions

**Consumed By:**

- All source modules have corresponding .test.js files
- `npm test` runs complete suite
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs on push/PR

**Integration Points:**

- Tests verify wiring between all v1.1 phases ✓
- Mocks all dependencies correctly ✓
- Validates command dispatch flows ✓
- Verifies CCR execution patterns ✓

**Key Coverage Areas:**

- Entry point integration (src/index.test.js) - 84% coverage
- Command dispatch for all 3 commands ✓
- Authorization check before execution ✓
- Workflow orchestrators ✓
- GitHub API integrations ✓

**Status:** Comprehensive test coverage validates integration of executed phases.

**Break Points:** NONE

**Gap:** Issue status updates missing (would be step 7.5 - requires Phase 9 code)

---

### Flow 4: Issue Tracking (EXPECTED BUT MISSING)

**Expected User Experience:**

```
User: @gsd-bot plan-phase 7
Bot: [creates planning docs]
     [creates GitHub issues for each task in plan]
     [applies status:pending labels]

User: @gsd-bot execute-phase 7
Bot: [executes tasks]
     [updates issue status: pending → in-progress → complete]
     [posts progress with issue links]
```

**Actual User Experience:**

```
User: @gsd-bot plan-phase 7
Bot: [creates planning docs]
     [DOES NOT create issues]

User: @gsd-bot execute-phase 7
Bot: [executes tasks]
     [DOES NOT update issue status]
     [posts progress without issue tracking]
```

**Integration Status:** BROKEN - Missing Phase 9 Implementation

**Missing Components:**

- src/lib/issues.js (does not exist)
- Integration points in phase-planner.js to call createIssuesForTasks
- Integration points in phase-executor.js to call updateIssueStatus

**Impact:** Users must manually track phase progress - no automated issue board.

---

## Orphaned Code Analysis

### 1. labels.js - STATUS_LABELS Taxonomy

**Exports:** 4 functions + 1 constant

- `STATUS_LABELS` - Array of 4 label definitions
- `ensureLabelsExist(owner, repo, labels)` - Create labels if missing
- `applyLabels(owner, repo, issueNumber, labels)` - Add labels to issue
- `updateIssueStatus(owner, repo, issueNumber, newStatus)` - Atomic status update

**Usage:** 0 external consumers

**Why Created:** Phase 8.1-01-PLAN.md lists these as requirements for Phase 9.

**Integration Path:** Would be imported by `src/lib/issues.js` (line 56 of 09-01-PLAN.md):

```javascript
import { ensureLabelsExist, STATUS_LABELS } from "./labels.js";
```

**Status:** ORPHANED - Code exists, tests pass (97% coverage), but no consumers.

**Risk:** Low - Well-tested, ready to integrate when Phase 9 executes.

---

### 2. projects.js - Partially Orphaned

**Exports:** 3 functions

- `getProject(owner, projectNumber, isOrg)` - Used internally ✓
- `getIterations(projectId)` - Used internally ✓
- `findIteration(owner, projectNumber, iterationTitle, isOrg)` - Used externally ✓

**Usage:** 1 external consumer (milestone/index.js)

**Why Created:** Phase 8.1-02-PLAN.md for milestone iteration validation.

**Integration Status:**

- `findIteration` is wired and working ✓
- Validates project iteration exists for new milestones ✓
- Graceful degradation if not configured ✓

**Orphaned Exports:**

- `getProject` and `getIterations` are only used internally by `findIteration`
- No other consumers planned (Phase 9 doesn't use these)

**Status:** PARTIAL - 1 of 3 exports consumed externally, others are helpers.

**Risk:** None - Helper functions serving active feature.

---

## Missing Connections

### 1. Phase Planner → Issue Creation

**Expected Connection:**

```javascript
// In phase-planner.js, after CCR execution succeeds
import { createIssuesForTasks, extractTasksFromPlan } from "../lib/issues.js";

const planContent = await fs.readFile(`.planning/phases/${phaseNumber}/...`);
const tasks = extractTasksFromPlan(planContent);
const issues = await createIssuesForTasks(
  owner,
  repo,
  tasks,
  phaseNumber,
  phaseName,
);
```

**Actual Code:** No import, no call - issues never created.

**Impact:** Planning completes successfully, but no GitHub issues exist for tasks.

---

### 2. Phase Executor → Issue Status Updates

**Expected Connection:**

```javascript
// In phase-executor.js, after parsing completed actions
import { updateIssueStatus, getPhaseIssues } from "../lib/issues.js";

const issues = await getPhaseIssues(owner, repo, phaseNumber);
for (const completedAction of parsed.completedActions) {
  const matchingIssue = findIssueForAction(issues, completedAction);
  if (matchingIssue) {
    await updateIssueStatus(owner, repo, matchingIssue.number, "complete");
  }
}
```

**Actual Code:** No import, no call - issue status never updated.

**Impact:** Execution completes successfully, but issues remain in "pending" status forever.

---

### 3. Labels Module → Issue Creation

**Expected Connection:**

```javascript
// In issues.js createIssuesForTasks function
import { ensureLabelsExist, STATUS_LABELS } from "./labels.js";

const phaseLabel = {
  name: `phase-${phaseNumber}`,
  color: "1d76db",
  description: `Phase ${phaseNumber} tasks`,
};
await ensureLabelsExist(owner, repo, [phaseLabel, ...STATUS_LABELS]);

const issue = await octokit.rest.issues.create({
  owner,
  repo,
  title: `${phaseNumber}: ${taskName}`,
  body: formatIssueBody(task, phaseNumber, phaseName),
  labels: ["status:pending", `phase-${phaseNumber}`],
});
```

**Actual Code:** File `issues.js` does not exist - connection never established.

**Impact:** Status labels exist in repo (created manually or by other workflows), but GSD never uses them.

---

## Requirements Traceability

### v1.1 Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status     | Implementation                                     | Phase | Notes                                 |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| PLAN-01     | COMPLETE ✓ | Command dispatch in index.js                       | 7     | `plan-phase` in ALLOWED_COMMANDS      |
| PLAN-02     | COMPLETE ✓ | executePhaseWorkflow in phase-planner.js           | 7     | Creates plans via GSD/CCR             |
| PLAN-03     | COMPLETE ✓ | Planning docs committed to .planning/phases/       | 7     | Verified by manual execution          |
| EXEC-01     | COMPLETE ✓ | executePhaseExecutionWorkflow in phase-executor.js | 8     | `execute-phase` command working       |
| EXEC-02     | COMPLETE ✓ | GSD reads .planning/ folder for resume             | 8     | Internal to GSD skill                 |
| RETRY-01    | COMPLETE ✓ | GSD workflow resume capability                     | 8     | Internal to GSD skill                 |
| ISSUE-01    | PENDING ❌ | Not implemented                                    | 9     | File issues.js does not exist         |
| ISSUE-02    | PENDING ❌ | Not implemented                                    | 9     | Issue body formatting not implemented |
| EXEC-03     | PENDING ❌ | Not implemented                                    | 9     | Status updates never wired            |

**Coverage:** 6 of 9 requirements complete (66.7%)

**Blocker Requirements:** None - ISSUE-01, ISSUE-02, EXEC-03 are enhancements, not blockers for core functionality.

---

## Impact of Skipped Phase 9

### What Works Without Phase 9

**Full Functionality:**

1. Milestone creation with requirements gathering ✓
2. Phase planning via GSD ✓
3. Phase execution via GSD ✓
4. Planning document generation ✓
5. Git branch management ✓
6. GitHub comment interactions ✓
7. Authorization checks ✓
8. Project iteration validation ✓

**User Can:**

- Create milestones with multi-turn conversation
- Plan phases autonomously
- Execute phases autonomously
- Review progress in GitHub comments
- Track planning docs in `.planning/` folder

---

### What's Missing Without Phase 9

**No Automated Issue Tracking:**

1. Users must manually create tracking issues
2. No automatic status updates (pending → in-progress → complete)
3. No GitHub Projects board automation (relies on status labels)
4. No task-to-issue mapping
5. No issue links in execution comments

**User Must:**

- Manually create issues for each task (or skip issue tracking entirely)
- Manually update issue status as work progresses
- Manually configure GitHub Projects automations (or use static board)

**Workaround:**

- Users can read progress from execution comments
- Users can track via git commits and planning docs
- External tools can parse `.planning/` folder for status

---

### Deliverability Assessment

**Question:** Can v1.1 be delivered without Phase 9?

**Answer:** YES, with documented limitations.

**Rationale:**

1. **Core Value Delivered:** "Enable autonomous AI-driven development via GitHub issue comments" is achieved.
   - All three commands work end-to-end ✓
   - Planning and execution are autonomous ✓
   - GitHub integration is functional ✓

2. **Requirements Met:** 6 of 9 requirements complete (66.7%)
   - All MUST-HAVE requirements (PLAN-\*, EXEC-01, EXEC-02, RETRY-01) complete ✓
   - Missing requirements are SHOULD-HAVE (issue tracking enhancements)

3. **No Blockers:** System is functional without Phase 9
   - No runtime errors
   - No incomplete flows that fail
   - No data corruption or inconsistencies

4. **Clear Upgrade Path:** Phase 9 can be added in v1.2
   - labels.js already exists and tested ✓
   - projects.js already exists and tested ✓
   - Integration points clearly defined in 09-PLAN files ✓
   - No breaking changes required

**Recommendation:** Ship v1.1 with Phase 9 deferred to v1.2.

**Documentation Required:**

- Known Limitations section in README
- Phase 9 roadmap item for v1.2
- Manual issue tracking guide for users who need it

## Test Coverage as Integration Validation

### Overall Coverage: 94.15%

**Test Files:** 20
**Test Cases:** 347
**All Passing:** ✓

### Coverage by Module Type

**Entry Point:**

- src/index.test.js - 84% coverage (fallback paths difficult to test)

**Workflow Orchestrators:**

- src/milestone/index.test.js - 97% coverage
- src/milestone/phase-planner.test.js - 100% coverage
- src/milestone/phase-executor.test.js - 100% coverage

**GitHub API Integration:**

- src/lib/github.test.js - 97% coverage
- src/lib/labels.test.js - 100% coverage
- src/lib/projects.test.js - 100% coverage

**Support Modules:**

- src/lib/parser.test.js - 100% coverage
- src/lib/validator.test.js - 100% coverage
- src/lib/config.test.js - 100% coverage
- src/auth/validator.test.js - 97% coverage
- src/git/\*.test.js - 100% coverage

### Integration Test Patterns

**Command Dispatch Tests (index.test.js):**

```javascript
it("dispatches new-milestone command to milestone workflow");
it("dispatches plan-phase command to phase planner");
it("dispatches execute-phase command to phase executor");
it("checks authorization before executing command");
```

**Workflow Integration Tests:**

```javascript
// phase-planner.test.js
it("executes CCR command with correct phase number");
it("posts output to GitHub on success");
it("posts error comment on failure");

// phase-executor.test.js
it("parses execution output into structured sections");
it("returns hasQuestions flag for continuation");
```

**Cross-Module Tests:**

```javascript
// milestone/index.test.js validates project iteration
it("validates project iteration when configured");
it("gracefully degrades when iteration not found");
```

**Verdict:** Test suite validates all active integrations. No orphaned code is tested in integration (only unit tests).

## Recommendations

### 1. Ship v1.1 As-Is (Recommended)

**Action:** Release v1.1 with Phase 9 deferred to v1.2

**Justification:**

- Core commands all working end-to-end ✓
- 6 of 9 requirements complete (66.7%) ✓
- No runtime errors or broken flows ✓
- Test coverage at 94.15% ✓
- Missing features are enhancements, not blockers ✓

**Required Documentation:**

```markdown
## Known Limitations (v1.1)

**Issue Tracking:** Automated GitHub issue creation and status updates are not yet implemented. Users should:

- Track progress via GitHub comments on the issue where commands are executed
- Review planning documents in `.planning/` folder for detailed status
- Manually create tracking issues if needed

**Roadmap:** Issue tracking integration is planned for v1.2.
```

---

### 2. Complete Phase 9 Before Release (Alternative)

**Action:** Execute Phase 9 plans before marking v1.1 complete

**Effort Estimate:** 3 plans × ~10 min each = ~30 minutes execution time

**Benefits:**

- 100% requirement coverage (9/9)
- Full issue tracking automation
- GitHub Projects board integration
- Status label usage

**Risks:**

- Delays v1.1 release
- Phase 9 may uncover issues requiring rework
- Integration testing for new flows needed

**Recommendation:** Only pursue if release timeline allows.

### 3. Mark Orphaned Code for Future Use

**Action:** Add comments to labels.js indicating future use

```javascript
/**
 * GitHub Status Labels Module
 *
 * Status: Created in Phase 8.1, ready for Phase 9 integration
 * TODO: Wire into lib/issues.js when Phase 9 executes
 *
 * Exports ready for use:
 * - STATUS_LABELS: Label definitions for phase tracking
 * - ensureLabelsExist: Create labels if missing
 * - applyLabels: Add labels to issues
 * - updateIssueStatus: Atomic status updates
 */
```

**Benefits:**

- Clear documentation of orphaned code purpose
- Prevents accidental removal during cleanup
- Signals readiness for integration

### 4. Enhance Test Coverage for Missing Flows

**Action:** Add skipped test cases for Phase 9 integration points

```javascript
// In phase-planner.test.js
describe.skip("Issue creation integration (Phase 9)", () => {
  it("creates GitHub issues after planning completes", async () => {
    // Test will be enabled when Phase 9 executes
  });
});

// In phase-executor.test.js
describe.skip("Issue status updates (Phase 9)", () => {
  it("updates issue status as actions complete", async () => {
    // Test will be enabled when Phase 9 executes
  });
});
```

**Benefits:**

- Documents expected integration points
- Provides test scaffolding for Phase 9 implementation
- Prevents regression when Phase 9 is added

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.1 Status:** OPERATIONAL WITH LIMITATIONS

**Integration Quality:** HIGH for executed phases, MISSING for Phase 9

**Deliverability:** YES - Core value delivered, limitations documented

**Next Steps:**

1. Update README with known limitations
2. Mark Phase 9 for v1.2 roadmap
3. Ship v1.1 release
4. Plan Phase 9 execution for v1.2 milestone

**Key Takeaway:** The absence of Phase 9 creates orphaned code (labels.js) and unmet requirements (ISSUE-01, ISSUE-02, EXEC-03), but does not block delivery of the core milestone value: autonomous AI-driven development via GitHub issue comments.
