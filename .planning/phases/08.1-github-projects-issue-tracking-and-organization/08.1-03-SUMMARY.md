# Phase 08.1 Plan 03: Project Setup Documentation Summary

**One-liner:** Comprehensive 313-line user guide for manual GitHub Project board setup with iteration management and label automations

## What Was Built

Created complete user documentation for setting up GitHub Projects integration with GSD workflow:

**Documentation (`docs/project-setup.md`):**
- 313 lines of comprehensive setup guide
- 9 major sections covering full setup workflow
- 28 subsection headers for detailed steps
- 6 code examples (YAML, JSON configuration)
- Troubleshooting section with 5 common issues
- Verification checklist and quick test procedure

**README Integration:**
- Added "Documentation" section with link to project-setup.md
- Minimal change for discoverability
- Positioned above "Planning Documents" for visibility

## Architecture Overview

The documentation explains the **labels + projects architecture**:

```
Status Labels (API-controlled) → GitHub Built-in Automations → Project Board (Visual)
     ↓                                      ↓                           ↓
status:pending                    Label trigger workflows         Cards move automatically
status:in-progress               Watch for label changes          No manual API calls needed
status:complete                  Update column positions          Human-readable organization
```

**Key architectural points:**
- Labels = source of truth (managed by GSD via REST API)
- Project board = visual layer (reacts to label changes)
- Built-in automations handle card movement (no custom code)
- Iterations group work by milestone (manual creation required)

## Implementation Details

### Documentation Coverage

**1. Overview (Labels + Projects Architecture)**
- Explains separation of concerns: labels for state, projects for visualization
- One iteration per milestone pattern
- API-driven vs UI-driven components

**2. Prerequisites**
- Repository/org permissions required
- Workflow permissions (contents, issues, pull-requests)
- Note about project: write scope (future-proofing)

**3. Creating the Project Board**
- Step-by-step for org vs repository projects
- Template selection (Board recommended)
- Repository linking and access verification

**4. Adding Iterations (Critical Section)**
- Manual UI-only creation process
- Iteration field setup
- Naming convention (match milestone versions)
- **Explains why manual:** API limitation causes data loss
- Links to GitHub Community Discussion #157957

**5. Configuring Label Automations**
- Auto-add workflow setup
- Initial status configuration
- Label-triggered column movement (4 status labels)
- Maps status:* labels to project columns

**6. Label Setup**
- Documents 4 status labels with colors
- Explains automatic creation by GSD
- Semantic color meanings (purple/yellow/green/red)

**7. Verifying Setup**
- Checklist for configuration validation
- Quick test procedure with manual label application
- Expected behavior verification

**8. Configuration (Optional)**
- gsd-config.json structure for project reference
- Project number and isOrg settings
- Future-proofing note (not yet used by GSD)

**9. Troubleshooting**
- "Iteration not found" warning → manual creation steps
- Labels not moving cards → automation configuration
- Permission errors → workflow file fixes
- Unassigned iterations → bulk edit process
- Auto-add not working → workflow enablement

### Code Examples

**1. Workflow Permissions (YAML)**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
```

**2. Project Configuration (JSON)**
```json
{
  "project": {
    "number": 1,
    "isOrg": true
  }
}
```

**3. Iteration Examples**
- v1, v1.1, v2 naming pattern
- Date range recommendations

## Decisions Made

### 1. Manual Iteration Creation Only

**Decision:** Document manual UI-only iteration creation process; do not attempt API creation

**Rationale:**
- GitHub Projects v2 API has critical limitation
- `updateProjectV2Field` mutation replaces ALL iterations (not append)
- Causes existing issues to lose iteration assignments (data loss)
- No safe API method exists as of 2026-01-22

**Evidence:**
- GitHub Community Discussion #157957 (multiple users confirm)
- Research document 08.1-RESEARCH.md findings
- No official GraphQL mutation for individual iteration addition

**Impact:**
- Users must create iterations manually before running workflows
- GSD can validate iterations exist but cannot create them
- Documentation becomes critical for initial setup

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Wait for GitHub to add iteration creation mutation (no ETA, blocks users)
- Use undocumented API (unreliable, unsupported, could break)
- Skip iterations entirely (loses milestone grouping benefits)

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: No risk of data loss, stable approach
- Pro: Aligns with GitHub's UI-first design for structural changes
- Con: Requires user action before automation can run
- Con: Additional setup step

### 2. Labels as Source of Truth Architecture

**Decision:** Use labels for state management, project board as visualization layer

**Rationale:**
- Labels are API-controllable via standard REST endpoints
- GitHub's built-in automations react to label changes automatically
- Project board updates require no custom API calls
- Simpler, more reliable than direct project manipulation

**Impact:**
- Status updates happen through label changes (GSD handles)
- Project board reflects label state via automations (GitHub handles)
- Fewer API calls, less potential for rate limiting
- Clear separation: automation layer (labels) vs UI layer (projects)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Direct project card updates via GraphQL (more API calls, more complexity)
- Manual project management (no automation, defeats purpose)

**Trade-offs:**
- Pro: Leverages built-in GitHub features (less custom code)
- Pro: Labels visible on issues without opening project
- Pro: Works with or without project board configured
- Con: Requires users to configure label automations (one-time setup)

## Files Changed

### Created Files

**`docs/project-setup.md` (313 lines)**
- Comprehensive setup guide for GitHub Projects
- 9 major sections, 28 subsections
- 6 code examples
- Troubleshooting and verification sections

### Modified Files

**`README.md` (+4 lines)**
- Added "Documentation" section
- Link to project-setup.md with description
- Positioned for discoverability

## Testing & Verification

**Verification performed:**
- ✓ File exists: `docs/project-setup.md` created
- ✓ Section count: 28 headers (exceeds requirement of 8+)
- ✓ Code examples: 6 code blocks (exceeds requirement of 2+)
- ✓ Line count: 313 lines (exceeds requirement of 100+)
- ✓ README updated: Link to project-setup.md present
- ✓ Coverage: All required topics covered (overview, prerequisites, project creation, iteration setup, label automations, troubleshooting)

**Success criteria met:**
- ✓ Complete setup guide in docs/project-setup.md
- ✓ User can follow guide to set up project board in 10-15 minutes
- ✓ Explains why iterations must be created manually
- ✓ README updated with link to documentation

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Phase Readiness

**Phase 9 (Issue Tracking Integration) can proceed:**
- Documentation established for users to set up projects
- Label architecture explained (status:pending, status:in-progress, etc.)
- Iteration structure documented (manual creation workflow)
- Users can set up project boards before Phase 9 ships

**Prerequisites for Phase 9:**
- Users must create project and iterations (documented in this plan)
- Label automations must be configured (documented in this plan)
- Phase 8.1-01 must ship label helpers (src/lib/labels.js)
- Phase 8.1-02 must ship project queries (src/lib/projects.js)

**No blockers or concerns.**

## Commits

| Commit | Type | Description | Files |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|
| 12d7334 | docs | Create project board setup guide | docs/project-setup.md |
| f182045 | docs | Add project setup link to README | README.md |

## Context for Future Work

**For Phase 9 (Issue Tracking Integration):**
- Users will have project boards configured per this guide
- Iterations will exist (manually created)
- Label automations will be active
- GSD can validate iteration exists before assigning issues
- GSD can apply labels knowing project will react automatically

**For future enhancements:**
- Monitor GitHub GraphQL changelog for iteration creation mutation
- If API becomes safe, update documentation and consider automated iteration creation
- Current manual approach remains valid fallback

**Documentation maintenance:**
- Update if GitHub adds iteration creation API
- Update if built-in automation options change
- Screenshots could enhance guide (not included due to staleness risk)
