<objective>
Create user documentation for GitHub Project board setup.

Purpose: Since iterations cannot be created safely via API (causes data loss), users must set up their project board manually. This guide provides clear step-by-step instructions for creating the project, adding iterations, and configuring label automations.

Output: `docs/project-setup.md` with complete setup instructions.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create project-setup.md documentation</name>
  <files>docs/project-setup.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/project-setup.md` with the following sections:

**1. Overview**
- Explain the label + projects architecture
- Labels = source of truth (API-controlled)
- Project board = visual organization (reacts to labels)
- One iteration per milestone (e.g., v1, v1.1, v2)

**2. Prerequisites**
- Repository admin or write access
- Organization owner access (for org projects)
- Workflow permissions (list required scopes):
  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: write
    issues: write
    pull-requests: write
    # Note: project: write only needed if future API iteration creation is added
  ```

**3. Creating the Project Board**
Step-by-step with screenshots/descriptions:
1. Go to repository or organization
2. Click Projects tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Select "Board" template (recommended) or "Table"
5. Name it (e.g., "GSD Milestones" or "{Repo} Work Tracking")
6. Add the repository to the project (Settings > Manage access)

**4. Adding Iterations (Milestones)**
Step-by-step:
1. Go to project Settings
2. Click on "Iteration" field (create if not present)
3. Click "Add iteration"
4. Name it to match milestone version: `v1`, `v1.1`, `v2`, etc.
5. Set start/end dates (optional but helpful)
6. Repeat for each milestone

**Why manual?** Explain briefly that the API for iteration creation replaces all iterations (data loss risk), so manual setup is required.

**5. Configuring Label Automations**
Step-by-step:
1. Go to project Settings > Workflows
2. Enable "Auto-add to project" - adds issues/PRs from repository
3. Enable "Item added to project" - set initial status
4. Create custom workflows for label-based column movement:
   - When `status:pending` label added -> Move to "Todo" column
   - When `status:in-progress` label added -> Move to "In Progress" column
   - When `status:complete` label added -> Move to "Done" column
   - When `status:blocked` label added -> Move to "Blocked" column (if you have this column)

**6. Label Setup**
Explain that GSD creates these labels automatically when needed:
- `status:pending` (purple) - Not started
- `status:in-progress` (yellow) - In progress
- `status:complete` (green) - Completed
- `status:blocked` (red) - Cannot proceed

No manual label creation required - the action handles this.

**7. Verifying Setup**
Checklist:
- [ ] Project created and linked to repository
- [ ] Iteration added for current milestone (e.g., `v1.1`)
- [ ] Label automations configured
- [ ] Test by manually adding a label to an issue

**8. Configuration (Optional)**
Show how to configure project number in `.github/gsd-config.json`:
```json
{
  "project": {
    "number": 1,
    "isOrg": true
  }
}
```

**9. Troubleshooting**
Common issues:
- "Iteration not found" warning: Create the iteration manually (step 4)
- Labels not moving cards: Check workflow automation settings
- Permission errors: Verify repository is linked to project

Format the document with clear headers, numbered steps, and code blocks where appropriate. Keep it practical - users should be able to follow it in 10-15 minutes.

  <name>Task 2: Create docs directory and update README</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
1. Create `docs/` directory if it doesn't exist (it doesn't based on earlier check)

2. Update `README.md` to link to the new documentation:
   - Find the appropriate section (likely "Getting Started" or add "Documentation" section)
   - Add link: `[Project Board Setup](docs/project-setup.md)`
   - Brief description: "For visual milestone tracking with GitHub Projects"

Keep README changes minimal - just add the link, don't restructure the document.

  <verify>
- Docs directory exists: `ls -d docs`
- README updated: `grep "project-setup.md" README.md`

- Documentation discoverable from main README

1. `docs/project-setup.md` exists with comprehensive setup guide
2. Guide covers: project creation, iteration setup, label automation, troubleshooting
3. README links to the new documentation
4. No mention of API-based iteration creation (manual only)
