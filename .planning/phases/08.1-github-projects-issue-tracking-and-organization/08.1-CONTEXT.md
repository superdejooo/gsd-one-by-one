# Phase 8.1: GitHub Projects & Issue Tracking and Organization - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-22
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Infrastructure for organizing milestone work via GitHub. Labels serve as the source of truth (controlled via API), GitHub Projects provides visual grouping and automatic card movement. Minimal API work — leverage GitHub's built-in automations.

This phase does NOT include creating issues during planning or updating issues during execution — that's Phase 9.

## Implementation Decisions

### Labels
- Label taxonomy for status tracking: `status:pending`, `status:in-progress`, `status:complete`
- Labels are the "source of truth" — our code controls these via REST API
- GitHub Project board reacts to label changes via built-in automations (we don't move cards manually)
- Helper functions: create labels, apply labels, update labels

### GitHub Projects
- Use iteration board type (GitHub's built-in project template)
- 1 iteration = 1 milestone (e.g., v1.1)
- Columns = status tracking (pending, in-progress, complete, etc.)
- ~2-3 API calls total:
  1. Get project ID
  2. Get current iterations
  3. Create new iteration
- Card movement handled by GitHub automations (label triggers column change)

### Integration with new-milestone
- When `new-milestone` command runs, also create new iteration on project
- Links milestone creation to project organization

### Documentation
- Tutorial/guide: how user sets up their GitHub Project board initially
- Steps: create iteration-type project, configure columns, set up label automations
- User enters version number as iteration name

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact label color scheme
- Project column naming conventions
- Error handling for missing project/permissions
- Whether to verify project exists before operations

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- "GitHub Projects automations do the heavy lifting — when we add a label, the card moves automatically"
- "Labels + Projects together, not one or the other"
- "Gratis grouping by milestone in the project view"
- Keep it simple: ~3 API calls for project, standard REST for labels

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
