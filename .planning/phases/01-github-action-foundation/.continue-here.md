<current_state>
Phase 01 (GitHub Action Foundation) is complete. All 3 plans executed and verified (4/4 must-haves passed).
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Task 1 (01-01): Create reusable GitHub Action with workflow triggers and basic inputs
  - Created package.json with @actions/core, @actions/github, @vercel/ncc
  - Created action.yml with 4 required inputs and node24 runtime
  - Created src/index.js entry point with core.getInput() and core.setFailed()
  - Status: Complete

- Task 2 (01-02): Configure scoped permissions and Node.js 24.x runtime
  - Added build script to package.json
  - Bundled action code with ncc into dist/index.js (31,998 lines)
  - Generated dist/licenses.txt for license compliance
  - Verified node24 runtime in action.yml
  - Status: Complete

- Task 3 (01-03): Implement concurrency control and clean exit handling
  - Created .github/workflows/gsd-command-handler.yml with:
    - issue_comment.created trigger only
    - Scoped permissions: contents: write, issues: write, pull-requests: write
    - Branch-based concurrency with cancel-in-progress
    - Action reference to superdejooo/gsd-github-action@v1
  - Verified clean exit handling (core.setFailed(), no process.exit())
  - Status: Complete
    </completed_work>

<remaining_work>
None - all phase tasks complete.
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Used @vercel/ncc for single-file bundling (industry standard for GitHub Actions)
- Node.js 24.x runtime configured explicitly to satisfy WORK-03 requirement
- Build script pattern established: `npm run build`
- Scoped permissions follow principle of least privilege (AUTH-01, AUTH-02)
- Concurrency group uses github.head_ref || github.ref pattern to handle both PR and issue comment events (CONC-01, CONC-02, CONC-03)
- Action uses core.setFailed() for errors instead of process.exit() (WORK-04)
  </decisions_made>

<context>
Phase 01 goal was to establish reusable GitHub Action infrastructure. All 4 success criteria from the roadmap are now met:

1. User can add workflow that references superdejooo/gsd-github-action@v1 and triggers on issue_comment - VERIFIED
2. Workflow has explicit scoped permissions (contents: write, issues: write, pull-requests: write) - VERIFIED
3. Concurrent workflow runs prevented on same branch but allowed on different branches - VERIFIED
4. Action uses Node.js 24.x runtime and exits cleanly - VERIFIED

Verification (01-VERIFICATION.md) shows all 4/4 must-haves passed with score 100%.

Ready to proceed with Phase 02 (Command Parsing & Config).
