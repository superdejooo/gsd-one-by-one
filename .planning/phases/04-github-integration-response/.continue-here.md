<current_state>
Phase 4 context gathering just completed via `/gsd:discuss-phase 4`. CONTEXT.md created with all implementation decisions captured. Phase 3 (CCR Integration) is complete and verified. Ready to begin Phase 4 planning.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Phase 3 (Complete):**
- 4/4 plans executed successfully
- CCR 2.1.15 stdin pipe architecture implemented
- Claude Code CLI + GSD plugin integrated
- Agent SDK removed (architecture finalized)
- NON_INTERACTIVE_MODE: true for CI safety
- Verification gaps closed

**Phase 4 Context Gathering:**
- Analyzed phase to identify gray areas
- Discussed 4 implementation areas with user
- Created 04-CONTEXT.md with decisions
- Committed context document

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Phase 4 (GitHub Integration & Response):**
- Plan 04-01: GitHub CLI operations for posting comments and responses
- Plan 04-02: Branch creation for milestones and phases with naming conventions
- Plan 04-03: Git configuration for commits and error handling with rate limiting

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**From Phase 4 context discussion:**

1. **Branch naming**: Flat structure `gsd/{milestone}-{phase}-{slug}` (e.g., `gsd/1-1-basic-user-auth`)
   - Milestone branches: `gsd/1`, `gsd/2`
   - Phase branches include descriptive slugs from roadmap

2. **Comment style**: Technical & precise
   - Full output in success comments
   - Rich markdown (code blocks, tables, collapsible sections)
   - No emojis, professional tone

3. **Git commits**: Conventional Commits format
   - Pattern: `type(scope): message (issue #N)`
   - Always reference triggering issue
   - Granularity defers to GSD plugin's atomic commit strategy

4. **Error handling**:
   - Summary + stack trace in collapsible details
   - Workflow run links configurable (errors/all/none)
   - Always include next-step suggestions
   - Auto-retry with backoff for rate limits

</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. Phase 3 complete, Phase 4 context gathered, ready to proceed.
</blockers>

<context>

**Project architecture status:**
- Phases 1-3 complete (GitHub Action foundation, command parsing, CCR integration)
- CCR stdin pipe architecture proven and working
- All verification gaps from Phase 3 closed
- Clean, consistent architecture across all artifacts

**Phase 4 focus:**
This phase enables the bot to actually interact with GitHub - the integration layer between CCR execution and GitHub itself. Three key areas:
1. Posting formatted comments (gh CLI)
2. Creating/managing branches (git + gh)
3. Committing planning artifacts (git config + commits)

**User preferences captured:**
- Wants technical precision over friendliness
- Full transparency (complete output, full error details)
- Traceability (issue references in commits, workflow links)
- Configurability (workflow links can be toggled)

**Next phase approach:**
Standard GSD flow - run `/gsd:plan-phase 4` which will:
1. Spawn gsd-phase-researcher to investigate GitHub CLI patterns
2. Spawn gsd-planner to create executable PLAN.md
3. Review and approve plan
4. Execute with gsd-executor

</context>

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:plan-phase 4` to begin Phase 4 planning. Researcher will read 04-CONTEXT.md and investigate:
- GitHub CLI comment formatting best practices
- Branch creation patterns in GitHub Actions
- Git configuration for bot commits
- Error handling and rate limit strategies

Planner will use research + context to create detailed task breakdown for all 3 plans.
</next_action>
